This repository contains the code and readme for the project work done for the course 'Statistical Structures in Data'.  

## Project Overview:
This project involves the analysis of four datasets, including identifying correlations between variables and visualizing distributions to better understand the data. It also requires the application of advanced techniques such as regression and PCA for dimensionality reduction.
- Dataset 1: Obesity Estimation dataset: This dataset includes data for the estimation of obesity levels in individuals from the countries of Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical condition. It has been taken from the UCI repository.
- Dataset 2: The data set refers to clients of a wholesale distributor. It includes the annual spending in monetary units (m.u.) on diverse product categories. It has been taken from the UCI repository.
- Dataset 3: The air quality dataset in R is a built-in dataset that contains daily air quality measurements in New York City from May to September 1973.
- Dataset 4: The ‘Tips’ dataset contains information about the tips given at a restaurant and includes various features related to the transaction. This dataset is available under the seaborn library in Python.
